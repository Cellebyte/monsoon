## Configure monsoon dashboards in Grafana
Grafana comes with several [dashboard templates](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) and configuration options, user can freely choose any of them, Following is an example of configuration of Grafana dashboards.\
Monsoon deploys 2 targets on the SONiC host, first one [node_exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/) running on 9100 and sonic_exporter is running on 9101 port, both of these targets serves different matrices, In this example we configure 2 different dashboards for each target.
  ### node_exporter dashboard
  There are many pre-built dashboard [templates available for node_exporter](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/?search=Node+Exporter) in this example we are using [Node Exporter Full](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860) template.
